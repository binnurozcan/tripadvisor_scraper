0,"I very rarely write a bad review but when you pay high prices and go expecting excellent service only to be let down I felt no option. 

We are visiting London so wanted a special night out. On arrival at Aqua at the Shard the...welcome was nice but when we sat down we just felt neglected. The service was very slow and throughout the whole meal we only managed to get two drinks even though asking a number of times. 

There were plenty of staff but they seemed to have a few key customers they were dealing with and certainly we were ignored most of the night. 

The food was nice but pricey, the view is ace but they have a lot to learn for how to look after customers. 

I certainly wouldn‚Äôt go backMore"
1,"For the view I‚Äôd give Aqua @ The Shard 5 out of 5 & I‚Äôd give the food 4 out of 5. It‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt the warmest but the food itself was of a high standard. 
However what let the experience down was the service and...thus service charge.
If anything they were too attentive. It‚Äôs great that you are asked if every is ok but not every 5 mins. I didn‚Äôt need advising on how to have my steak cooked for example. The main issue was the staff were over attentive however when I asked if I could have some more gravy ‚Ä¶ I think they referred to it as Beef Juice, the waiter joked and said that would be another ¬£5. Anyway the gravy never arrived & as we were finishing up our dessert the waiter approached and apologised, half joking that they would in fact owe me ¬£5 for forgetting. 
The bill came and of course they hadn‚Äôt deducted anything but had of course added 12.5% service charge.
Great be attentive but be sincere with it. 
I don‚Äôt mind paying over the odds as you are paying for an experience but to add the service charge on to what wasn‚Äôt a cheap meal anyway, you need to make sure you‚Äôve earned it. Maybe I should have complained. I usually do but I didn‚Äôt want to detract from the experience of my fellow  diners. 
Could do better.More"
2,"We had the 5 course tasting and wine pairing menu and were throughly disappointed . The service was very lacking, every course we had to ask for the pairing wine as it didn‚Äôt appear with the food and was forgotten about with no apologies from...the staff. Food was very bland and unfulfilling which given the cost is unacceptable. Only plus point was the view if you were lucky another to get a table by the window.  I honestly believe if this place was on the ground floor it wouldn‚Äôt survive. Would recommend going for one drink to see the view and then going somewhere else to eat.More"
3,"We 2 sisters went to Aqua Shard for brunch at 2pm  on a Saturday. We were shown to our table and provided with  2 menus. After 20 mins our waiter returned to take our menu choices for all 3 courses. The starter arrived and was...Egg Benedict and Waffles. The waffles starter was a decent size but the egg benedict was on the small size. Half a muffin, 1 egg, square of ham and some sauce. we waited quite a long time for Pork Rib Eye (very small serving) and Beef. We had watched all of the Beef requests being carried through and each plate had a large Yorkshire pudding on. My plate didn‚Äôt have one. I asked a passing waiter if I should have had one and he laughed and said it had ‚Äúflown away‚Äù. He brought one on a separate plate but by the time he brought it all my food was cold. 
Our waiter asked if we wanted tea or coffee but we said we hadn‚Äôt had dessert and he said ‚Äúlet me check‚Äù. He arrived with cutlery and i asked for a Port to go with my cheese choice. I waited and waited - we asked another waiter if he could bring it and he brought it. We then ordered tea for two. 
When we booked the table the reservation said we only had the table for 2 hours: however, the S L O W service meant we were there for 2 1/2 hours. 
Our brunch was ¬£49 each - the total bill was ¬£188.98. EVERYTHING is an extra. 
SUMMARY: 327 miles from home for an ‚Äòaverage‚Äô experience and the food, quite frankly wasn‚Äôt worth it. We had a better meal at Hard Rock Cafe for half the priceüò©More"
4,"Wonderful experience and food. 3 courses, all excellent. Staff were excellent and our server Justo was really lovely. We felt very well treated and would definitely recommend."
5,"Amazing restaurant, and very helpful staff had a wonderful experience. Really happy with everything."
6,"Rarely can I be bothered to leave a review but I was motivated by such a poor Sunday brunch experience at Aqua that I thought I‚Äôd share my thoughts 
The place has a cold canteen style vibe with little finesse a bored looking member of...staff mopping around you as you dined
Waitress poor and unhelpful food bought out at different times ours 20 mins after our sons!!!!
No salt or pepper offered and when requested pepper bought empty
I felt like should tell somebody when I was there that I was disappointed but I could tell the waitress wouldn‚Äôt care and  nobody about looked in charge or particularly interested
I‚Äôd say great view they need to hang onto that because they have little else to offer honestly don‚Äôt bother going I‚Äôm not sure from my visit whether they care or not if you doMore"
7,Mediocre afternoon tea experience. Very little food given for the price. We asked for a refill of tea and the waiter seemed confused by our request. The service fee is higher than the standard rate in the U.K (at 13.5%) and the quality of service...we received wasn‚Äôt reflected at that percentage.More
8,"We arrived 30 minutes early for our table booking hoping to grab a drink in the bar. We were immediately seated and then sat for 20 mins trying to get someone‚Äôs attention to order.
Several tables were seated after us and had drinks within minutes....When the drinks finally arrived, the cocktail was not nice and not worth the price tag or the wait.

We then moved to our table for dinner and had a lovely window seat. The views are lovely.

Our waiter was very nice and efficient with food ordering but our starter came out 5 minutes after ordering which seemed a bit too quick.

Our whole meal was done within an hour, which again is probably the quickest/rushed 3 course meal we have ever had.

The smoked salmon starter was average, but the beef fillet main was great. The new potato side is really lovely.

We shared a dessert and neither of us enjoyed it very much (the chocolate sphere)

The drinks service again was not great as my partner ordered a bottle of beer which was forgotten and arrived the same time as our bill..

Overall not a particularly special experience for the cost as everything was very hit and miss.

There are nicer options available for this price range.More"
9,"Amazing views well worth the price of350 plus for the meal ,just a little dark inside but to maximise the views no one was drinking wine when I looked at the list I can see why ,food basic but nice enough"
10,"We visited for lunch, my husband was disappointed not to be sat at the window especially as he booked as soon as the system was opened for that day and their were spaces available. Me I didn't mind. The  welcome was friendly. Husband had the...venison starter which was tasty but soooo small, i had the smoked duck very nice. We both had the seabass main which was very rich and just needed a little more to make it seem a good size for a main. i am not a sweet eater but did enjoy mine. We had the matching wine which work well with the starts but a bit floral the white with the seabass but could see it working well with the chicken or hake. The english sparkling we had was very apply. Overall the portions were small and we both left  not full up.More"
11,"Was prepared to be Wowed! but was not. Had the lamb which was good but not outstanding. Had 4 staff asked if we wanted drinks even though I repaired repeatedly said we just wanted wine. Very dark so hard to read the menu or to...find the loo which was equally as dark. Sommelier was nice. Menu is limited. We were rushed through our meal (or tried to rush us through our meal) even though we had booked 2 hrs and we left early. Did not see that with other tables around us necessarily. Maybe bc we were 2 women out for dinner?! Will not return.  Views, of course, were spectacular. Security tight.More"
12,"We came to have a nice drink with good views but were instead met with disappointment.

After mumbling something inaudible the waiter showed us to our table and we ordered.

After the drinks finally arrived and we'd stayed as long as we wanted, we asked...for the bill but were told we needed to pay ¬£50 or else order something else.

Apparently there's a minimum ¬£25pp charge which you're told when you get to the door so I expressed my disappointment and annoyance this wasn't made more obvious.

Instead of making a fuss, we ordered another drink and waited another 20 minutes to be presented with the most overpriced and disappointing cocktail I've ever tasted.

To top it all off to congratulate us for being patient with their slow service and mediocre drinks, we had to pay a 13.5% service charge too!

Save your money and go to the Sky Gardens rather than deal with this pathetic excuse to seem like a posh establishment. The view isn't worth it anyway.More"
13,"Very disappointed in todays visit to this dreadful restaurant. Very appalling service and food. We paid ¬£262 for a service that was cold abrupt and ridiculous 
. I would never go back nor recommend to any person. Cold steak half cooked. Small portions and lean...fat that supposed to be cooked pork. Staff were rude and not welcoming at all. Disgusting service and shocking. So bitter that it ruined a day for all 4 of usMore"
14,"I was expecting a lot more for ¬£52.00 for the afternoon tea. Service was good . I was expecting the sandwiches (only 2) pork pie , a mushroom and a fish thing in a nice stand but was on a normal plate . Deserts were...nice on a pirate ship. Scones were a nice size. Only offered the one pot of tea each.  You pay for the views. Get better for cheaper where we live. Unfortunately won‚Äôt be doing this againMore"
